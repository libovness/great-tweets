What is the Great Scaling?

I'm not sure [college->work] is the main driver of that, instead its something lost in the Great Scaling. Walmart for ex didn't just kill mom and pop stores, they killed professionals that serviced them, reducing the # of local accountants, lawyers etc that towns enjoyed. https://twitter.com/ConradBastable/status/1270764924940292096
